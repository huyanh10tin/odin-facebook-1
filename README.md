This site is a simple Facebook clone.
Built using Rails, this toy site is the capstone project for
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a>'s Ruby on Rails course.
This project utilizes many of the programming skill sets I have learned up to this point, including but not limited to:
RESTful resources, MVC architecture, user authentication and authorization, data model relationships, third-party API integration, and testing.
For more information about this project, check it out
