A simple Facebook clone. This project is built in Rails and is the capstone project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)'s Ruby on Rails course.
This project integrates many of the programming skill sets I have learned up to this point, including but not limited to: MVC, authentication and authorization, data model relationships, and testing.
For more information about this project, check it out [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project?ref=lnav).
