          <p>
            This site is a simple Facebook clone.
            Built using Rails, this toy site is the capstone project for
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a>'s Ruby on Rails course.
            This project integrates many of the programming skill sets I have learned up to this point, including but not limited to:
            MVC, authentication and authorization, data model relationships, and testing.
            For more information about this project, check it out
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project?ref=lnav">here</a>.
